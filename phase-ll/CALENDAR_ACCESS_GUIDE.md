## Quick Access to Calendar - Step by Step

### Option 1: Direct URL Access (Fastest)

**Just type this in your browser:**
```
http://localhost:3000/calendar
```

If you're logged in, the calendar will load immediately.

### Option 2: Check If You're Logged In

**Open your browser and check the header:**
- ✅ If you see "My Tasks" → You ARE logged in
- ❌ If you see "Sign In" → You are NOT logged in

**If NOT logged in:**
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/signin
2. Enter your email and password
3. Click "Sign In"
4. After login, go to http://localhost:3000/calendar

### Option 3: Make Browser Window Wider

The Calendar link is hidden on small screens. Try:
1. Maximize your browser window
2. Make it at least 640px wide
3. Hard refresh: **Ctrl + Shift + R**
4. Look for "Calendar" next to "My Tasks" in the header

### What the Calendar Link Looks Like

When visible, it appears in the header as:
```
📅 Calendar
```
(with a calendar icon)

### Test Right Now

**Copy and paste this URL into your browser:**
```
http://localhost:3000/calendar
```

**What should happen:**
- ✅ If logged in: Calendar page loads with month grid
- ❌ If not logged in: Redirects to sign-in page

### Still Can't See It?

Please tell me:
1. Are you logged in? (Do you see "My Tasks" in the header?)
2. How wide is your browser window? (Full screen or narrow?)
3. What happens when you go to http://localhost:3000/calendar directly?

This will help me provide a more specific solution.
